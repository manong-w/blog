I recently realized why using Vim is such a pleasure compared to using other text editors. Though I imagine you can acheive similar speeds with other editor shortcuts, programming with Vim feels like playing a game.

I grew up using Microsoft Word as my only text editor until I started programming, where ~95% of my introductory computer science class used Sublime. It looked pretty, so I used it as well for about 2 years.

Then I gave Vim a serious try [1]. I was much slower for roughly two weeks, but then I noticed I was looking forward to text editing. Not programming -- text editing. It was merely convenient that I was in the business of writing code because it gave me a lot of text to edit (levels of the game to play).

It made me more productive, but the greater attachment is that it gave me a new way of thinking about text editing. It's like when you want to get a child to do a chore by turning it into a game. I took it as a given that editing text was just a necessary chore of programming, and hadn't even considered that it could be made into a game until I used Vim. If I could control the cursor in a text-editor with my mind, and jump to anywhere on the screen I could think of with 100% accuracy, it would probably be more productive but less fun.

When you start out as a level 1 Vim noob, your inventory consists only of `h,j,k,l`. You're often tempted to cheat with arrow keys, but you don't gain experience points this way so it's best to avoid that. As you progress, you discover commands like `w,e,b,0,$` to traverse within a line more efficiently. But wait, there's more -- combos like `ci)` and `y2j` that do things you always wanted to but never knew was possible [2]!

You get the metaphor. I find that I look forward to text-editing because it's a chance for me to use my arsenal of text-traversal shortcuts. As an avid video-gamer, I relate the feeling to discovering a cool Vim command to unlocking a new weapon in a game -- I can't wait to try it.

A side effect of that is it adds to the joy of programming. Computer science problems can be solved with pen and paper if you're only in it for the fun of solving puzzles. To me, the fun of programming is also in keeping my brain active at all times: either I'm thinking, which is the primary game, or I'm traversing text to put my thoughts onto the machine, the secondary game.

### Notes:

1. And Emacs, but I just liked the design choices of Vim better; I'm sure this essay could be swapped with Emacs too from the way I see people using it.
2. Compostability is, after all, one of the main selling points that gave Vim its popularity.
